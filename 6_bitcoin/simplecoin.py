# SimpleCoin: Minimal UTXO Ledger and Blockchain Simulation
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# This module implements a simplified, educational model of a Bitcoin-like UTXO system.
#
# Description:
#   The system tracks coins (UTXOs) created and consumed by transactions and records them
#   on a linear blockchain. Each block contains exactly one transaction for simplicity.
#   Transactions are of two types:
#     - CreateCoin: Mints new coins (only the trusted authority G can issue them)
#     - PayCoin:    Consumes existing coins and creates new ones of equal total value
#
#   The Ledger is the central authority that validates transactions, assigns sequential
#   transaction IDs, appends blocks to the chain, and maintains the set of unspent coins.
#
# Key components:
#   - Coin:                   Represents a single UTXO (transaction_id, output_index, value, recipient_pubkey)
#   - Transaction:            Base class providing transaction type and assigned ID
#   - CreateCoinTransaction:  Creates new coins; no inputs; assigned outputs get IDs upon assignment
#   - PayCoinTransaction:     Consumes input coins and creates new output coins; signatures required
#   - Block:                  Wraps a single transaction with a reference to the previous block hash
#   - Ledger:                 Validates transactions, updates UTXO set, and appends blocks to the chain
#
# Validation rules (enforced in Ledger.process_transaction):
#   1) Inputs must exist and be owned by the signer(s).
#   2) No double-spending: inputs must be currently unspent in the ledger.
#   3) Conservation of value: sum(inputs) == sum(outputs).
#   4) Valid signatures from owners of all consumed coins.
#
# Signatures:
#   - verifySignature(pubKey, message, signature) is a stub used for demonstration.
#     In this simulation it accepts signatures of the form "sig_for_<pubKey>" and
#     does not perform real cryptography.
#
# IDs and blocks:
#   - The Ledger assigns monotonically increasing transaction IDs.
#   - Each block’s "hash" is simplified to the transaction’s ID.
#   - The chain is a list of Blocks; last_block.hash is stored in each new Block.
#
# Public API highlights:
#   - Ledger.create_new_coins(values, recipients): Mint new coins via CreateCoin.
#   - Ledger.process_transaction(tx): Validate and, if valid, append to the chain.
#   - Ledger.get_balance(pubkey): Sum of unspent coins for an owner.
#   - Ledger.get_transaction_history(): List of (tx_id, tx_type).
#   - Ledger.print_full_state(): Debug printout of chain, UTXO set, and balances.
#
# Simplifications:
#   - No networking, consensus, mining, or PoW; single validator (G).
#   - One transaction per block; block hash == tx id; no timestamps or Merkle trees.
#   - Signatures are mocked; no real cryptographic verification is performed.
#
# Educational purpose:
#   This code is intended to illustrate core UTXO and validation concepts, not to serve
#   as a secure or production-ready cryptocurrency implementation.
